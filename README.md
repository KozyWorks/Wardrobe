# Wardrobe
## Software Development Plan
### Describe at a high level what the application will do
Wardrobe is the application that bascially has two different options.

One is for the "Clerk" of the clothes store where he/she can view the clothes those are available in the store, add and remove the clothes from their database. Currently it utilizes plain .txt files rather than real Database (DB) system.

On the other hand the application also supports the "Customer" mode which allows the customer to view all the clothes available in the store, add the item into the shopping cart and make a payment via credit card. The current system only allows the payment method of credit card, but it is possible to be extended to PayPal, direct debit, Afterpay, etc.

### Identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
The purpose of this application is to allow the store and clerk to easily manage the items available in the store and to reduce the time spent on them manually tracking each items.

On the customer's perspective, it is to ease them tracking their shopping cart and also to provide the fluent experience of the online shopping.

### Identify the target audience
The target audiences would be any clothing stores which are having difficulties on managing their stocks. The current system is focused on clothes, but this could be extended further in the future and could be used as a prototype for those who are willing to open their online store of any kinds.

### Explain how a member of the target audience will use it
The current system is built as a terminal application where the user gets prompted to choose their user type between "Clerk" and "Customer". If the user is not willing to proceed any further, they also get an option to quit the program.

Once the user chooses user type, they are prompted with several options where they can add, delete and view items to the database and also to the shopping cart.

Every time when the user types in invalid option or the input, the user will be informed an error that their option or input is not valid.

### Features and description

#### .txt based database
There are four different categories of clothes available for the current system and data for each categories are stored in separate .txt files to easily manage them and details include:
- name **(String)**
- brand **(String)**
- type **(String)**
- color **(String)**
- size **(Integer)**
- stock **(Integer)**
- price **(Float)**

where each details are separated with "ã€€" and each item is stored in each line.

The program will go through each item and create the object based on their type, the category. The created instance will then be stored into a hash called "clothes" where this hash is a class variable. That being said no matter how many Wardrobe instance gets created, this will be shared through the class.

This hash gets updated through the iteration of the program which gets stored into the each .txt files before the program gets terminated.

#### Shopping cart
Shopping cart is an array of clothes which is stored in Wardrobe object as an instance variable. That said, the shopping cart is unique to each wardrobe object and thus the user can have their own shopping cart in theory.
